# pigeon.ex3.lol
The website for my Discord bot, pigeon.

# What is this?
Static files designed for Cloudflare Pages

# Where is the index.html, you psychopath?
It's `flow.html`. Looks cooler. If you visit `pigeon.ex3.lol/`, it'll redirect you to `pigeon.ex3.lol/flow`.

`/i/` and `/flow` are inspired by Twitter/X. `/i` is the path for features like [Community Notes](https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch)/[Birdwatch](https://x.com/i/communitynotes), [Grok](https://x.com/i/grok), [release notes](https://x.com/i/release_notes), etc. `/flow` is the path for logging in and other stuff.

# How do I run this?
Run what, some documents?
