        <h1><a href="/flow">pigeon</a>: privacy policy</h1>
        <section>
            <p>pigeon is a Discord AI chatbot made and maintained by <a href="https://ex3.lol">exerinity</a>.</p>

            <h3>What data is collected</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User, channel, and server IDs:</strong> Stored long-term. These help the bot function
                    properly across Discord.</li>
                <li><strong>Chat transcripts:</strong> Stored temporarily in memory for smoother conversations. They're
                    wiped if you run <code>/clearhistory</code> or the bot restarts.</li>
                <li><strong>Message and command counts:</strong> The number of times you've sent a message or cleared
                    history is tracked just for fun and shown in <code>/stats</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What’s not collected</h3>
            <p>
                Anything not listed above.
            </p>

            <h3>Your controls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Run <code>/remove</code> to clear your server information and channel ID. If you are kicking the
                    bot, <strong><i>run this first</i></strong>.</li>
                <li>Use <code>/clearhistory</code> to reset your chat history.</li>
                <li>Email me at <a href="https://ex3.lol/email">this link</a> to delete your message count data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Other stuff</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>pigeon is not intended for use by people under 13, and so is Discord.</li>
                <li>Data is stored on a private server. Transcripts are in memory only; IDs live in a JSON file with
                    basic protection, as it's public information.</li>
                <li>No notifications for policy updates — check back here if you're curious.</li>
                <li>Error logs exist, but they don’t include user info.</li>
                <li>The bot is closed-source, but soon-to-be open. It's not ready, it's "still in the womb", in a way.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The bottom line is: no private or critical data is collected or stored. Some basic data is stored, but
                easily removable.<br>
                Chat transcripts are not stored. Once you run <code>/clearhistory</code>, they are gone forever.<br>
                The model is Llama 4 Scout.
            </p>
